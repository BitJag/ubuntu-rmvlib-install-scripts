 In order to add graphics to a project, an entry for your graphics  file should be placed in the 
 
 /gfx/data/gfx_data.s
 
 And should follow this convention for unpacked data:
 
    gfx_data  _LABLE,"/path/to/file.rgb"
    
And this convention if it is packed:
    
    gfx_data_packed _LABLE,"/path/to/file.lz77"
    
 ----------------------
 NOTE:
 
 Additional '.s" files can be added for better organization, as long as they are placed in the same folder as the 'gfx_data.s' file
